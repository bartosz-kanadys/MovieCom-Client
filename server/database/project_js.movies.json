And that is exactly what happens to firefighter Jeff Elliott and his wife Ruth who are living their dream in the golden Midwest; high school sweethearts, married with two beautiful and healthy children, family farm, horses, sports, church groups, the whole American Dream come true. And one winters day, teenage son Eric \"Hoovey\" Elliott collapses at high school basketball practice, is rushed to the hospital, and the doctors find a tumor the size of an orange at the base of his brain. They're down to hours-if surgery that risks the boy's ability to walk, talk, and perhaps even survive is not performed immediately, Hoovey's young life will end before it truly even begins. In a grueling 8-hour procedure, the tumor is removed. And he survives. But for the Elliott family, life and dreams will never be the same. Hoovey has to teach himself to walk again, to read again, to even see straight with two unbalanced eyes, covered one at a time by an eye patch. Forget ever stepping on a basketball court - the risk of receiving a fatal blow to the spot on his head is just too great. As the unpaid medical bills mount, Jeff's firefighting salary isn't enough, the family is swimming in crippling debt seemingly overnight, everything he and Ruth have built in their life dream of two kids is at stake. Hoovey's teenage sister Jen feels alone and nearly forgotten in the most important time of her life. And as Hoovey realizes his one dream in life-playing this game-is gone, too, he sinks into a deep sadness. This is a family at risk. With no-one to turn to, but themselves and their God. HOOVEY is the true and inspiring story of the Elliott family, who refused to surrender, instead turning to one another and their faith in the worst of circumstances, to rebuild their lives, their boy, and their dreams... together. Step by grueling step, with faith, love, and the tireless work of a mother and father to save their family, their farm, their dream, Hoovey learns to walk again. To read again. To dribble and shoot a basketball again. And yes, to dream again himself. Then stepping out in his faith, back onto the hard court, to live that dream of playing this game once more...",

Tris's initiation day should have been marked by celebration and victory with her chosen faction; instead, the day ended with unspeakable horrors. War now looms as conflict between the factions and their ideologies grows. And in times of war, sides must be chosen, secrets will emerge, and choices will become even more irrevocable--and even more powerful.

  "title": "Circle",
  "fullplot": "In a massive, mysterious chamber, fifty strangers awaken to find themselves trapped with no memory of how they got there. Organized in an inward-facing circle and unable to move, they quickly learn that every two minutes, one of them must die... executed by a strange device in the center of the room. At first, the attacks seem random, but soon the strangers realize that they, as a group, have the power to decide who will be the next to be killed. A vote. A chance to control the machine. But how can they choose who deserves to die? And what happens when there's only one person left? Circle is a film about people, how they value one another, and what they do under the worst possible circumstances. A film about what makes us human - who we are, what we believe, and ultimately, the lengths we will go to save ourselves.",

  "fullplot": "For twenty-five years Brenda Myers-Powell called herself 'Breezy' and she dominated her world, or that's what she thought. It was a world that had turned her into a teenage, drug-addicted prostitute. After a violent encounter with a 'john,' Brenda woke up in the hospital and decided to change her life. Today she is a beacon of hope and a pillar of strength for hundreds of women and girls as young as fourteen who want to change their own lives. 'Dreamcatcher' explores the cycle of neglect, violence and exploitation which each year leaves thousands upon thousands of girls and women feeling that prostitution is their only option to survive. By following the very charming, charismatic and truly empathic Brenda, we enter the lives of young women and see in verite footage their realities from their points of view. While the world may overlook these women and men, thankfully Brenda has not, providing an unflinching expose which contrasts seeming hopelessness against the difference that one person can make in the lives of many.",

Although they share the land and a way of life, Gummi and Kiddi have not spoken to each other in four decades. When a lethal disease suddenly infects Kiddi's sheep, the entire valley comes under threat. The authorities decide to cull all the animals in the area to contain the outbreak. This is a near death sentence for the farmers, whose sheep are their main source of income, and many abandon their land. But Gummi and Kiddi don't give up so easily - and each brother tries to stave off the disaster in his own fashion: Kiddi by using his rifle and Gummi by using his wits. As the authorities close in the brothers will need to come together to save the special breed passed down for generations, and themselves, from extinction.",

American Hostage tells the story of four terrorists coming together to create change within the American government and affect their stance on Guantanamo Bay. With tensions high, emotions between the terrorists collide, which sets the story into a downward spiral. American Hostage unveils the story of Asad, Hamal, Shahin and Fahdah, who each has their own motive for joining the war in terror. Asad, the appointed leader of the group, manages the team with strict and clear direction, taking orders behind the scenes from Al-Saqri whose motives are unclear. Asad shows one weakness, the affection for fellow terrorist Fahdah, a soft spoken young Arab woman. Asad and Fahdah develop an adoration for each other, despite the disapproval from Fahdah's brother Hamal whose anger from the overall situation escalates throughout the story. Meanwhile Shahin, the fourth terrorist, and prisoner Sergeant Donald Young begin to form a bond as they share stories about family, faith and love. Although the plan of gaining explicit media coverage after leaking the hostage tapes, the U.S. government shows no cooperation in response to the demands on Guantanamo Bay. The terrorists go through extreme measures in attempts to persuade the government one final time.

Best of Enemies delves into the entangled biographies of these two great thinkers and luxuriates in the language and the theater of their debates, begging the question, 'What has television done to the way we discuss politics in our democracy today?'",

  "title": "Wolf Hall",
  "fullplot": "England in the 1520s is a heartbeat from disaster. If the King dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years and marry Anne Boleyn. The Pope and most of Europe oppose him. Into this impass steps Thomas Cromwell: a wholly original man, a charmer, and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people, and implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph?",
